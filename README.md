## Version 0

[X] Plain HTML, CSS, JS

I firstly wanted to create everything in plain technologies. For having the nerdy control over everything and settling knowledge. Knowledge in this case would be vanilla JavaScript, because HTML & CSS are child play for me.

But I reached a point where I have enough of writing the CSS manually. And also don't see myself doing manual HTML between multiple pages sharing the same header and footer. So I go what I wanted with this "version" and move on using a framework - to make my life simpler.
